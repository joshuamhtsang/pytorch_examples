Change directory into the dockerfiles/pytorch_jmt/ and you will find 
a Dockerfile.  Build this image:

$  sudo docker build -t "pytorch_jmt" .

If you now:

$  docker image ls

You should see your image built.  Now you can make an instance of it:

$  docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/cwd/ -p 8888:8888 pytorch_jmt

Obviously, make sure the current directory containes the source code
(*.ipynb) files so the the docker container can see it in /cwd/.
